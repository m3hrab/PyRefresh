   - Loops (`for`, `while`)
3. **Functions**  
   - Defining and calling functions  
   - Arguments and return values  
   - Understanding scope
4. **Lists & Tuples**  
   - Creating, modifying, and slicing lists  
   - List comprehensions
5. **Dictionaries & Sets**  
   - Key-value pairs, adding and updating dictionaries  
   - Set operations
6. **File I/O**  
   - Reading and writing files

<!-- ## 🎯 Tomorrow's Topics & Goals 

Tomorrow, I plan to dive deeper into Python and explore more advanced topics:

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
   - Classes and objects  
   - Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism
2. **Generators**  
   - Creating generators with `yield`  
   - Practical use cases of iterators
3. **Decorators**  
   - Function decorators to enhance functionality
4. **Context Managers**  
   - Managing resources efficiently with `with`
5. **Unit Testing**  
   - Writing basic tests using `unittest`

> **My Goal**: Understand the underlying principles of OOP and explore more efficient ways to handle resources and code reuse. -->
